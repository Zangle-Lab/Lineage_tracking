# Lineage_tracking
Code for QPI-based lineage tracking

Major steps executed in this workflow:
1) Compute background of wells (CommonWellBackground/main_well_avg.m)
2) Split images into subimages (AlignSubImages/main_image_align.m)
3) Perform cell tracking
4) Perform track reconnection
5) Perform generation tracking
6) Add track masses to get total mass per well
