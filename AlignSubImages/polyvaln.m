function ypred = polyvaln(polymodel,indepvar)
% polyvaln: evaluates a polynomial model as a function of its variables
% usage: ypred = polyvaln(polymodel,indepvar)
%
% Syntax
%
% ypred = polyvaln(polymodel,indepvar)
%
% arguments: (input)
%  indepvar - (n x p) array of independent variables as columns
%        n is the number of data points to evaluate
%        p is the dimension of the independent variable space
%
%        IF n == 1, then I will assume there is only a
%        single independent variable.
%
%  polymodel - A structure containing a regression model from polyfitn
%        polymodel.ModelTerms = list of terms in the model
%        polymodel.Coefficients = regression coefficients
%  
%        Note: A polymodel can be evaluated for any set of
%        values with the function polyvaln. However, if you
%        wish to manipulate the result symbolically using my
%        own sympoly tools, this structure should be converted
%        to a sympoly using the function polyn2sympoly.
%
% Arguments: (output)
%  ypred - nx1 vector of predictions through the model.
